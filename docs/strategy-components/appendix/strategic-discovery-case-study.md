# Strategic Discovery Process: Case Study

## Overview

This case study documents an actual Strategic Discovery conversation with a company called Priority, which is building an AI-powered Self-Service Strategic Consulting platform for marketing. It highlights how the conversational approach, personified through "Ethan," effectively uncovered strategic insights and generated actionable recommendations.

## Company Profile

- **Company Name**: Priority
- **Industry**: Marketing Technology / Business Consulting / SaaS
- **Team Size**: 2 people (consultant founder and designer)
- **Stage**: Pre-product launch, early stage
- **Business Model**: B2B SaaS/PaaS
- **Target Market**: Early-stage companies and SMEs

## Key Strategic Challenges Identified

1. **Pricing Strategy Uncertainty**: "We are unsure of how to price our service, AI pricing has a lot of variance. Is it better to take a usage, capped vs something else."

2. **Positioning and Messaging Challenges**: "Also our messaging, we are not sure if the world is ready for a consultancy that's AI yet or if we should frame it as something else."

3. **Strategy-Execution Gap**: "So far it has been bad, but due to the aforementioned skill issue. We are currently building the platform we need to help our potential users."

4. **Goal Setting and Timeline Management**: "We have set dates and missed them. It's probably been more to do with underestimating the complexity than anything else."

5. **Zero-Budget Approach**: "We have a zero budget thinking at the moment, so we have used our skills and learned new ones like coding and vibe coding to get it done."

## Strategic Insights from Discovery Process

### Strengths Uncovered

1. **Clear Unique Value Proposition**: 
   > "It is more of a multi-faceted approach so vs traditional consultancies it would be availability on budget, on the other hand people could use ChatGPT or another engine to get help or notion or even templates in excel, none of the current options would give the user either a full process or efficient AI that has continuous context."

2. **Strategic Vision and Adaptability**:
   > "The initial idea was to make me more productive and then we realized it would be possible to get the AI to fill in some of the gaps."

3. **Innovative Approach to Capability Building**:
   > "We will build this into our platform... we will dog food this for ourselves which will be incredibly useful."

4. **Strong Team Collaboration**:
   > "We tend to working on things together, but I also get her to be user 0 on things to test if it's viable for both of us."

### Strategic Gaps Identified

1. **Strategy-to-Execution Connection**:
   - **Gap**: Difficulty translating strategic decisions into consistent action
   - **Impact**: Missed deadlines and implementation challenges
   - **Quick Win**: Weekly "Strategic Sync" meeting (15-30 min) with co-founder
   - **Structural Fix**: Implementing structured project management methodologies that account for complexity

2. **Capability Development Formalization**:
   - **Gap**: Current capability building limited to "learning to code"
   - **Impact**: Potential skill gaps in other areas needed for launch
   - **Quick Win**: Create simple capability development roadmap for next 3-6 months
   - **Structural Fix**: Integrate capability development tracking into the platform itself

3. **Resource Allocation and Goal Setting**:
   - **Gap**: No formal alignment between strategy and resource allocation
   - **Impact**: Difficulty setting realistic timelines and goals
   - **Quick Win**: Define 1-2 primary strategic KPIs tied to revenue goals
   - **Structural Fix**: Implement "Growth Tasks" concept for task-to-strategy alignment

## Recommended Next Workflows

Based on the identified strengths and gaps, the Strategic Discovery Process recommended the following specific workflows:

1. **Marketing Strategy Workflow - Pricing Strategy Component**:
   - Addresses uncertainty around AI pricing models
   - Provides structured framework for evaluating usage-based vs. capped pricing
   - Includes market analysis of competitive pricing models in AI SaaS

2. **Marketing Strategy Workflow - Positioning Statement Component**:
   - Helps clarify market positioning as AI-powered consultancy
   - Guides development of messaging that addresses market readiness concerns
   - Provides framework for competitive differentiation

3. **Project Management Workflow - Timeline Estimation Component**:
   - Addresses challenges with missed deadlines
   - Provides techniques for estimating complex development tasks
   - Includes buffer planning for unknown complexities

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):**
- Implement weekly "Strategic Sync" meeting between co-founders
- Define 1-2 primary strategic KPIs tied to revenue goals
- Create simple capability development roadmap

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6):**
- Complete Marketing Strategy Workflow's Positioning Statement component
- Begin developing more realistic timeline estimation approach
- Document "user 0" testing process for future team members

**Phase 3 (Weeks 7-12):**
- Complete Marketing Strategy Workflow's Pricing Strategy component
- Begin formalizing "Growth Tasks" concept implementation
- Implement structured project management methodology

## Outcomes and Value

The Strategic Discovery Process provided Priority with:

1. **Structured Self-Awareness**: A comprehensive view of their strategic landscape through Ethan's guided conversation.

2. **Prioritized Action Plan**: Clear next steps focusing on their most critical needs.

3. **Specific Workflow Recommendations**: Direct guidance on which platform workflows would address their specific challenges.

4. **Implementation Timeline**: A phased approach to implementing recommendations based on urgency and resource constraints.

5. **Strategic Context**: Rich documentation of their business context that can inform future strategic decisions and onboarding of new team members.

## Conversation Flow Analysis

The conversation with Priority demonstrated several advantages of the new consultant-led approach:

1. **Natural Information Gathering**: The conversation flowed naturally from topic to topic, making it feel like a consulting session rather than a rigid assessment.

2. **Inference and Confirmation**: Ethan made intelligent inferences about the business model and industry based on initial descriptions, avoiding redundant questions.

3. **Contextual Adaptation**: Questions were tailored based on the two-person team size and pre-launch status.

4. **Expert Validation**: Ethan validated certain approaches ("dogfooding" the platform) while gently highlighting improvement areas.

5. **Specific, Actionable Recommendations**: The process concluded with concrete recommendations tied to Priority's specific challenges.

## Lessons Learned and Improvements

Based on this case study, several improvements were identified:

1. **Response Conciseness**: Some of Ethan's responses could be more concise, particularly when summarizing information already provided.

2. **Internal Thinking Visibility**: Occasional "Thoughts" sections were visible to the user, which should be hidden in the final implementation.

3. **Recommendation Automation**: The need for explicit user requests for recommendations should be eliminated in favor of automatic generation.

4. **Workflow Integration**: Clearer "next steps" for starting recommended workflows would improve the transition to action.

These learnings have been incorporated into subsequent refinements of the Strategic Discovery Process.
