# Pipit Documentation

Welcome to the central documentation for the Pipit platform. This directory contains all of the technical and product documentation for the project.

## Directory Structure

-   **/features**: Contains detailed documentation for specific, user-facing features of the application, such as Document Export and the Marketing Agency integration.
-   **/strategy-components**: This is the core of the product documentation. It outlines the strategic thinking, architectural patterns, and individual components that make up our AI-driven workflows.
-   **/workflows**: This section provides a high-level overview of the user-facing workflows, such as the initial "Discovery" process and the comprehensive "Marketing Strategy" workflow.

## How it Fits Together

1.  **Workflows** are the high-level, user-facing experiences (e.g., "Discovery Workflow").
2.  **Strategy Components** are the underlying building blocks, patterns, and architectural decisions that are used to create the workflows.
3.  **Features** are the specific, tangible capabilities that are integrated into the workflows (e.g., the ability to export a document at the end of a workflow).

This documentation is a living resource and should be updated regularly to reflect the current state of the project.
