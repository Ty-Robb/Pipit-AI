class PowerPointService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prs = Presentation()
    
    def create_marketing_strategy_deck(self, strategy_data):
        # Title slide
        self.add_title_slide(strategy_data['company_name'])
        
        # Vision & Mission
        self.add_vision_mission_slide(
            strategy_data['vision'],
            strategy_data['mission']
        )
        
        # SWOT Analysis
        self.add_swot_slide(strategy_data['swot'])
        
        # Target Personas
        for persona in strategy_data['personas']:
            self.add_persona_slide(persona)
        
        # Save and return
        return self.save_presentation()
```
