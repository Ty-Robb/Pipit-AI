**User**: "I need help developing a new software product for small businesses."

**Agent**: "I'd be happy to help you develop a new software product for small businesses. This process will guide you through the entire product development lifecycle, from initial concept to market launch. First, could you tell me about your product vision? What problem are you trying to solve for small businesses, and what are your objectives for this product?"

**User**: "We want to create a tool that helps small businesses manage their inventory more efficiently. Many small businesses still use spreadsheets or even paper-based systems."

**Agent**: "That's a great focus area. Inventory management is indeed a pain point for many small businesses. Before we dive deeper into the product concept, could you tell me a bit more about your target customers? What types of small businesses are you primarily focusing on (retail, manufacturing, services), what size range, and what are their specific challenges with inventory management?"
