# Marketing Skills Assessment Agent

The Marketing Skills Assessment Agent is a specialized AI agent that helps users identify their marketing team's capability gaps and develop a skills matrix with development recommendations. This document provides an overview of the agent's implementation, capabilities, and integration with the Pipit platform.

## Overview

The Marketing Skills Assessment Agent guides users through a structured process to assess their marketing team's skills, identify strengths and weaknesses, and create a development plan. It helps businesses ensure they have the right capabilities to execute their marketing strategy effectively by evaluating both core and specialized marketing skills, prioritizing gaps, and providing specific development recommendations.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented as a Genkit flow within the Pipit application:

- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/marketing-skills-assessment.ts`
- **Key Components**:
  - A Genkit `flow` that defines the conversational logic.
  - Zod schemas for input and output validation.
  - Tools for web search and data persistence.

## Six-Phase Approach

The agent uses a structured six-phase approach to guide users through the marketing skills assessment process:

1.  **Phase 1: Introduction & Assessment Scope**: Determine the scope of the assessment based on team size, structure, and strategic priorities.
2.  **Phase 2: Core Marketing Skills Evaluation**: Assess the team's core marketing skills, such as strategic planning, content creation, and digital marketing.
3.  **Phase 3: Specialized Skills Assessment**: Evaluate specialized skills based on the business model and industry.
4.  **Phase 4: Skills Gap Analysis**: Identify and prioritize critical skill gaps.
5.  **Phase 5: Development Recommendations**: Recommend development approaches for each prioritized gap.
6.  **Phase 6: Implementation Planning**: Create a skills development roadmap with clear milestones.

## Web Search Integration

The agent leverages web search capabilities to enhance the skills assessment process with real-time, data-driven insights:

- Researches current marketing skills in highest demand.
- Finds statistics on marketing skills gaps in the user's industry.
- Researches recommended courses, certifications, or training programs.
- Finds case studies of successful marketing team development.

## Output Deliverables

The agent helps users create:

1.  **Marketing Skills Matrix**: A comprehensive assessment of current capabilities vs. importance.
2.  **Prioritized Gap Analysis**: A ranked list of skill gaps with impact assessment.
3.  **Development Plan**: Specific recommendations for each priority gap.
4.  **Implementation Roadmap**: A timeline and milestones for skills development.
5.  **Resource Recommendations**: Specific courses, tools, and learning resources.

## Integration with Other Flows

The Marketing Skills Assessment Agent is a modular component that can be called from other, more comprehensive flows.

```typescript
// A simplified example of how the marketing skills assessment flow might be called
import { marketingSkillsAssessmentFlow } from './marketing-skills-assessment';
import { runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';

async function runMarketingStrategy() {
    // ... other strategy steps

    const skillsAssessmentResult = await runFlow(marketingSkillsAssessmentFlow, {
        contentStrategy: 'We focus on educational content...',
        channelStrategy: 'We primarily use content marketing and email.',
        // ... other inputs
    });

    // ... continue with the rest of the strategy
}
```

This modular approach allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the agents reusable and easy to maintain.
