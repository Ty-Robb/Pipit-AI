# Content Strategy Agent

The Content Strategy Agent is a specialized AI agent that helps users develop a comprehensive content strategy aligned with their marketing goals. This document provides an overview of the agent's implementation, capabilities, and integration with the Pipit platform.

## Overview

The Content Strategy Agent guides users through a structured process to establish a content framework that delivers the right content to the right audience at the right time. It helps marketing teams define their content objectives, identify target audiences, plan content types, establish content themes, create a content calendar, and set up measurement frameworks.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented as a Genkit flow within the Pipit application:

- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/content-strategy.ts`
- **Key Components**:
  - A Genkit `flow` that defines the conversational logic.
  - Zod schemas for input and output validation.
  - Tools for web search and data persistence.

## Five-Phase Approach

The agent uses a structured five-phase approach to guide users through the content strategy development process:

1.  **Phase 1: Introduction & Content Objectives**: Align content with business and marketing goals.
2.  **Phase 2: Audience & Content Mapping**: Map content types to audience segments and buyer journey stages.
3.  **Phase 3: Content Themes & Topics**: Identify core content themes and brainstorm specific topic ideas.
4.  **Phase 4: Content Calendar & Production Planning**: Create a content calendar and plan the production workflow.
5.  **Phase 5: Measurement Framework & Optimization**: Define KPIs and an optimization approach for content performance.

## Web Search Integration

The agent leverages web search capabilities to enhance the content strategy development process with real-time, data-driven insights:

- Researches industry-specific content trends and best practices.
- Finds statistics on content consumption preferences for relevant audience segments.
- Researches effective content formats and types for specific industries.
- Finds examples of successful content strategies in similar businesses.

## Output Deliverables

The agent helps users create:

1.  **Content Objectives**: Defined objectives aligned with business goals.
2.  **Audience-Content Matrix**: Mapping of content types to audience segments.
3.  **Content Themes and Topics**: An organized content hierarchy with specific topic ideas.
4.  **Content Calendar**: A quarterly plan with themes, types, channels, and goals.
5.  **Measurement Framework**: KPIs and an optimization approach for content performance.

## Integration with Other Flows

The Content Strategy Agent is a modular component that can be called from other, more comprehensive flows.

```typescript
// A simplified example of how the content strategy flow might be called
import { contentStrategyFlow } from './content-strategy';
import { runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';

async function runMarketingStrategy() {
    // ... other strategy steps

    const contentStrategyResult = await runFlow(contentStrategyFlow, {
        personas: ['Technical Project Managers', 'Department Heads'],
        // ... other inputs
    });

    // ... continue with the rest of the strategy
}
```
This modular approach allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the agents reusable and easy to maintain.
