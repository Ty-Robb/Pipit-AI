# Channel Strategy Agent

The Channel Strategy Agent is a specialized AI agent that helps users develop a comprehensive channel strategy aligned with their marketing goals. This document provides an overview of the agent's implementation, capabilities, and integration with the Priority AI platform.

## Overview

The Channel Strategy Agent guides users through a structured process to establish a channel mix that delivers the right content to the right audience through the most effective channels. It helps marketing teams evaluate different marketing channels, match channels to audience segments, allocate budget across channels, create a channel mix strategy, and establish KPIs for each channel.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented as part of the workflow agents in the Priority AI platform:

- **Location**: `adk-agents/workflow_agents/sub_agents/channel_strategy_agent/`
- **Key Files**:
  - `__init__.py`: Exports the agent function
  - `agent.py`: Contains the agent implementation
  - `prompt.py`: Contains the conversation guidance
  - `test_channel_strategy_agent.py`: Contains unit tests

## Five-Phase Approach

The agent uses a structured five-phase approach to guide users through the channel strategy development process:

1. **Phase 1: Introduction & Channel Objectives**
   - Introduce the purpose of the channel strategy development process
   - Discuss the importance of aligning channels with business and marketing goals
   - Help the user define 3-5 specific, measurable channel objectives
   - Ensure objectives are tied to business outcomes
   - Validate that the objectives are realistic and achievable

2. **Phase 2: Channel Evaluation & Selection**
   - Present common marketing channels based on the user's industry and business model
   - Discuss strengths, weaknesses, audience demographics, content formats, cost structure, and measurement capabilities for each channel
   - Guide the user to select 5-8 primary channels based on alignment with target audience, fit with content strategy, available resources, budget constraints, and competitive landscape

3. **Phase 3: Audience-Channel Mapping**
   - Review existing persona information or help create simplified audience profiles
   - Identify preferred channels, content consumption habits, buyer journey stage, and channel-specific messaging considerations for each audience segment
   - Create an audience-channel matrix that maps channels to audience segments and buyer journey stages
   - Prioritize channel-audience combinations based on business impact
   - Discuss how different channels can work together across the customer journey

4. **Phase 4: Channel Mix & Budget Allocation**
   - Recommend a balanced channel mix based on short-term vs. long-term objectives, funnel stages, media types, and experimental vs. proven channels
   - Guide the user through allocating their marketing budget across channels
   - Create a high-level quarterly channel plan with budget allocation, key initiatives, seasonal adjustments, and testing opportunities

5. **Phase 5: Measurement Framework & Optimization**
   - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for each channel
   - Recommend tools and methods for tracking channel performance
   - Establish a review cadence for channel performance analysis
   - Suggest an approach for channel optimization based on performance data
   - Discuss A/B testing strategies for continuous improvement
   - Create a simple reporting template for channel performance

## Web Search Integration

The agent leverages web search capabilities to enhance the channel strategy development process with real-time, data-driven insights:

- Researches industry-specific channel benchmarks and best practices
