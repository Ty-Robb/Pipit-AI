# Campaign Planning Agent

The Campaign Planning Agent is a specialized AI agent that helps users develop comprehensive marketing campaigns aligned with their business goals and marketing strategy. This document provides an overview of the agent's implementation, capabilities, and integration with the Pipit platform.

## Overview

The Campaign Planning Agent guides users through a structured process to plan, execute, and measure marketing campaigns that deliver measurable results. It helps marketing teams define campaign objectives, identify target audiences, develop campaign themes and messaging, create a campaign calendar, plan campaign execution across channels, and set up campaign measurement and optimization.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented as a Genkit flow within the Pipit application:

- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/campaign-planning.ts`
- **Key Components**:
  - A Genkit `flow` that defines the conversational logic.
  - Zod schemas for input and output validation.
  - Tools for web search and data persistence.

## Six-Phase Approach

The agent uses a structured six-phase approach to guide users through the campaign planning process:

1.  **Phase 1: Campaign Objectives & KPIs**: Define specific, measurable campaign objectives and establish key performance indicators.
2.  **Phase 2: Target Audience & Insights**: Identify and understand the target audience for the campaign.
3.  **Phase 3: Campaign Theme & Messaging**: Develop a compelling campaign theme and key messages.
4.  **Phase 4: Campaign Calendar & Timeline**: Establish a realistic campaign timeline and create a content calendar.
5.  **Phase 5: Channel Strategy & Execution Plan**: Select the most appropriate channels and develop execution plans.
6.  **Phase 6: Measurement & Optimization**: Establish a measurement framework and an optimization strategy.

## Web Search Integration

The agent leverages web search capabilities to enhance the campaign planning process with real-time, data-driven insights:

- Researches industry-specific campaign benchmarks and best practices.
- Finds statistics on campaign performance and ROI for relevant industries.
- Finds examples of successful campaigns in similar industries.
- Researches channel-specific campaign tactics and best practices.

## Output Deliverables

The agent helps users create:

1.  **Campaign Objectives & KPIs**: Defined objectives with clear success metrics.
2.  **Target Audience Profiles**: A detailed understanding of the campaign's audiences.
3.  **Campaign Theme & Messaging**: A compelling campaign concept and key messages.
4.  **Campaign Calendar**: A timeline with key milestones and activities.
5.  **Channel Execution Plan**: A detailed plan for campaign execution across channels.
6.  **Measurement Framework**: A plan for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing campaign performance.

## Integration with Other Flows

The Campaign Planning Agent is a modular component that can be called from other, more comprehensive flows.

```typescript
// A simplified example of how the campaign planning flow might be called
import { campaignPlanningFlow } from './campaign-planning';
import { runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';

async function runMarketingStrategy() {
    // ... other strategy steps

    const campaignResult = await runFlow(campaignPlanningFlow, {
        channelStrategy: 'We prioritize LinkedIn, industry publications, and email marketing.',
        // ... other inputs
    });

    // ... continue with the rest of the strategy
}
```
This modular approach allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the agents reusable and easy to maintain.
