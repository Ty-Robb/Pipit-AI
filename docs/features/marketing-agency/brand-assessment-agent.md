This assessment is crucial for building a resilient and impactful brand strategy.

## Implementation Details

## Integration with Other Flows

The Brand Assessment Agent is a modular component that can be called from other, more comprehensive flows.

```typescript
// A simplified example of how the brand assessment flow might be called
import { brandAssessmentFlow } from './brand-assessment';
import { runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';

async function runMarketingStrategy() {
    // ... other strategy steps

    const brandAssessmentResult = await runFlow(brandAssessmentFlow, {
        personas: 'Our primary personas are project managers and team leads.',
        // ... other inputs
    });

    // ... continue with the rest of the strategy
}
```
This modular approach allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the agents reusable and easy to maintain.
