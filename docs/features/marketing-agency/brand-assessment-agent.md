## Integration with Ethan Coordinator

The Brand Assessment Agent is integrated into the Ethan Coordinator workflow in the "Positioning & Messaging" section, following the Customer Understanding components (Persona Development, Customer Journey Map, and Buying Process).

```python
# In ethan_coordinator.py
from .sub_agents.brand_assessment_agent.agent import brand_assessment_agent

# ...

ethan_coordinator = LlmAgent(
    # ...
    tools=[
        # ...
        # Customer Understanding
        AgentTool(agent=buying_process_agent),
        
        # Positioning & Messaging
        AgentTool(agent=brand_assessment_agent),
        
        # ...
    ],
)
```

## Usage Example

```python
from adk_agents.workflow_agents.sub_agents.brand_assessment_agent import brand_assessment_agent

# Call the agent with user message and optional context
response = brand_assessment_agent(
    user_message="I need to evaluate how my brand is currently perceived in the market.",
    conversation_history=[],  # Optional: Previous conversation history
    context="We are a B2B SaaS company in the project management space.",  # Optional: Business context

    buying_process="The buying process involves multiple stakeholders."  # Optional: Buying process
)

# Process the agent's response
print(response.content)
```

## Relationship to UI Workflow

This agent powers the Brand Strength Assessment workflow described in `docs/strategy-components/workflows/marketing-strategy/brand-assessment.md`. While the UI workflow document focuses on the user interface and interaction patterns, this agent provides the AI-powered conversation and analysis capabilities that drive the assessment process.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Brand Assessment Agent include:

1. Integration with brand monitoring tools and social listening platforms
2. Enhanced competitive analysis using real-time market data
3. Automated brand audit report generation with visualizations
4. Industry-specific brand assessment templates and benchmarks
5. Integration with brand asset management systems
