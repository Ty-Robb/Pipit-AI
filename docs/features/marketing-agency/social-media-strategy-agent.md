# Social Media Strategy Agent

The Social Media Strategy Agent is a specialized AI agent that helps users develop a comprehensive social media strategy aligned with their marketing goals. This document provides an overview of the agent's implementation, capabilities, and integration with the Pipit platform.

## Overview

The Social Media Strategy Agent guides users through a structured process to establish a social media framework that effectively engages their target audience, builds brand presence, and drives measurable business results. It helps marketing teams define their social media objectives, identify target platforms, plan content approaches, establish posting schedules, create engagement strategies, and set up measurement frameworks.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented as a Genkit flow within the Pipit application:

- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/social-media-strategy.ts`
- **Key Components**:
  - A Genkit `flow` that defines the conversational logic.
  - Zod schemas for input and output validation.
  - Tools for web search and data persistence.

## Six-Phase Approach

The agent uses a structured six-phase approach to guide users through the social media strategy development process:

1.  **Phase 1: Introduction & Social Media Objectives**: Align social media activities with business and marketing goals.
2.  **Phase 2: Platform Selection & Audience Analysis**: Prioritize social media platforms based on audience presence and business objectives.
3.  **Phase 3: Content Strategy & Voice**: Define content pillars, formats, and voice guidelines for social media.
4.  **Phase 4: Posting Schedule & Content Calendar**: Establish optimal posting frequency and a content calendar framework.
5.  **Phase 5: Community Management & Engagement**: Develop guidelines for responding to comments and engaging with the community.
6.  **Phase 6: Measurement Framework & Optimization**: Define KPIs and an optimization approach for social media performance.

## Web Search Integration

The agent leverages web search capabilities to enhance the social media strategy development process with real-time, data-driven insights:

- Researches platform-specific best practices and algorithm updates.
- Finds statistics on social media usage and demographics for relevant platforms.
- Researches industry benchmarks for engagement rates and posting frequency.
- Finds examples of successful social media strategies in similar businesses.

## Output Deliverables

The agent helps users create:

1.  **Social Media Objectives**: Defined objectives aligned with business goals.
2.  **Platform Selection**: Analysis and prioritization of social platforms.
3.  **Content Strategy**: Content pillars, formats, and voice guidelines.
4.  **Posting Schedule**: Optimal posting frequency and content calendar framework.
5.  **Community Management Guidelines**: A plan for engagement and moderation.
6.  **Measurement Framework**: KPIs and an optimization approach for social media performance.

## Integration with Other Flows

The Social Media Strategy Agent is a modular component that can be called from other, more comprehensive flows.

```typescript
// A simplified example of how the social media strategy flow might be called
import { socialMediaStrategyFlow } from './social-media-strategy';
import { runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';

async function runMarketingStrategy() {
    // ... other strategy steps

    const socialMediaStrategyResult = await runFlow(socialMediaStrategyFlow, {
        contentStrategy: 'We focus on educational content...',
        personas: ['Technical Project Managers', 'Department Heads'],
        // ... other inputs
    });

    // ... continue with the rest of the strategy
}
```
This modular approach allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the agents reusable and easy to maintain.
