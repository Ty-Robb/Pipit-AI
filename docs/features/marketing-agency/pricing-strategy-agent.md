# Pricing Strategy Agent

The Pricing Strategy Agent is a specialized AI agent that helps businesses develop effective pricing strategies for their products and services. It guides users through a structured process to establish a comprehensive pricing framework that aligns with their business objectives, market positioning, and competitive landscape.

## Overview

Pricing is one of the most critical elements of a business's marketing strategy, directly impacting revenue, profitability, market positioning, and customer perception. The Pricing Strategy Agent helps businesses navigate the complex process of developing a pricing strategy that balances multiple factors including costs, customer value perception, competitive positioning, and market conditions.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented as a Genkit flow within the Pipit application:

- **Location**: `src/ai/flows/pricing-strategy.ts`
- **Key Components**:
  - A Genkit `flow` that defines the conversational logic.
  - Zod schemas for input and output validation.
  - Tools for web search and data persistence.

## Six-Phase Approach

The agent uses a structured six-phase framework to guide users through the pricing strategy development process:

1.  **Phase 1: Introduction & Pricing Objectives**: Define pricing objectives and understand the business context.
2.  **Phase 2: Market & Competitive Analysis**: Analyze market conditions, customer price sensitivity, and competitor pricing.
3.  **Phase 3: Pricing Model Selection**: Select the most appropriate pricing model (e.g., value-based, competitive, cost-plus).
4.  **Phase 4: Price Point Determination**: Set specific price points, tiers, and discount structures.
5.  **Phase 5: Implementation & Communication**: Plan the pricing implementation and communication strategy.
6.  **Phase 6: Monitoring & Optimization**: Establish metrics and a framework for ongoing price optimization.

## Web Search Integration

The agent leverages web search to provide up-to-date information on:
- Industry-specific pricing benchmarks and trends.
- Competitor pricing strategies.
- Pricing psychology studies and best practices.
- Successful pricing case studies.

## Output Deliverables

The agent produces a comprehensive pricing strategy that includes:
1.  A summary of pricing objectives and business context.
2.  The selected pricing model(s) with rationale.
3.  Specific price points or a detailed pricing structure.
4.  An implementation and communication plan.
5.  A monitoring and optimization framework.

## Integration with Other Flows

The Pricing Strategy Agent is a modular component that can be called from other, more comprehensive flows.

```typescript
// A simplified example of how the pricing strategy flow might be called
import { pricingStrategyFlow } from './pricing-strategy';
import { runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';

async function runMarketingStrategy() {
    // ... other strategy steps

    const pricingResult = await runFlow(pricingStrategyFlow, {
        positioningStatement: 'For mid-market companies who need efficient project management...',
        competitorAnalysis: { ... },
        // ... other inputs
    });

    // ... continue with the rest of the strategy
}
```
This modular approach allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the agents reusable and easy to maintain.
