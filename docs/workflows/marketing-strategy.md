## Technical Implementation

The Marketing Strategy Workflow is implemented as a series of interconnected Genkit flows. Each section of the workflow corresponds to a main flow that, in turn, calls other, more specialized flows (our "agents") to handle specific tasks.

### Architecture Pattern

```typescript
// Simplified example of the main marketing strategy flow
import { defineFlow, runFlow } from '@genkit-ai/flow';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { visionStatementFlow } from './vision-statement';
// ... import other sub-flows

export const marketingStrategyFlow = defineFlow(
  {
    name: 'marketingStrategyFlow',
    inputSchema: z.any(), // Will be defined based on required inputs
    outputSchema: z.any(), // Will be defined based on the final strategy document
  },
  async (input) => {
    // Section 1: Foundations
    const vision = await runFlow(visionStatementFlow, input);
    // ... run mission and core values flows

    // ... continue through all 8 sections

    // Return the complete strategy document
    return { ... };
  }
);
```

This modular, flow-based architecture allows for a clean separation of concerns and makes the individual components of the marketing strategy workflow reusable and easy to maintain.
