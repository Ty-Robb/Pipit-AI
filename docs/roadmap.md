# Pipit: Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and long-term vision for the Pipit platform.

## Phase 1: Core Product Enhancement (Post-Launch)

-   **Complete all 22 Workflows**: Systematically implement the full suite of marketing strategy workflows using our existing Genkit framework.
-   **Advanced File Viewers**: Add support for viewing CSV, Markdown, and various image formats.
-   **Search Optimization**: Introduce advanced filtering, search history, and suggestions.
-   **File Organization**: Implement folders, tagging, and bulk actions for better document management.
-   **Export and Publishing**: Enhance options for exporting and publishing strategic documents.
-   **UI Polish**: Improve loading states, add subtle animations, and enhance mobile responsiveness.

## Phase 2: Collaboration and Monetization

-   **Collaboration Features**: Introduce real-time collaboration, commenting, and team management.
-   **Credit-Based System**:
    -   Design and implement a credit-based system for accessing advanced features and workflows.
    -   Integrate with a payment processor (e.g., Stripe) to handle credit purchases.
    -   The "Discovery" workflow will remain free as an entry point to the platform.

## Phase 3: Advanced AI and Genkit Integration

-   **Sophisticated Agent Development**:
    -   Develop and deploy more advanced agents directly within our Genkit/Node.js architecture.
    -   These agents will handle complex tasks like in-depth competitor analysis with web search, market segmentation, and other data-intensive operations.
-   **Marketing Agency Integration**:
    -   Develop a Genkit tool that acts as an API client to integrate with a "Marketing Agency" agent for specialized, automated services.

This roadmap will be reviewed and updated regularly based on user feedback and market demands.
